# Clean_Code

This repository contains my notes and code examples from the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin. When I first started programming, I decided to read this book to learn the principles of clean code. I included the tips I found interesting and considered valuable for programmers across various fields in the repository.

## Purpose of the RepositoryÂ 

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Summarize key concepts from Clean Code.
* Share practical examples and tips for writing better code.
* Serve as a reference for developers who want to revisit important clean coding principles.
